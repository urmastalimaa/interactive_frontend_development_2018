# JavaScript build process example

## Running the application

```text
yarn install
yarn build
open public/index.html
```

### Expected behaviour

* A title in the center of a greenish background is seen on the page
* "I'm a robot" is logged to browser console

## Explanation

### Dependency installation

```text
yarn install
```

Installs all the dependencies that are listed in package.json. The dependencies usually target the NPM repository, but can target a public VCS repository \(e.g GitHub\). The `npm` dependency management and installation tool can also be used, but `yarn` has mostly superceded it by much faster and having saner defaults.

* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
* [NPM repository](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [NPM CLI](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)

### Build scripts

```text
yarn build
```

`build` refers to the `build` script that is defined in [_package.json_](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive_frontend_development_2018/tree/cdb4bae60178ff8cb84deb048ae3ba7f93a069f5/lecture_1/package.json#L26). This is equivalent to running `./node_modules/.bin/webpack --config webpack.config.js` from the command line.

### Webpack

Webpack generates a JavaScript file \(_public/app.js_\) using the specified configuration file \([_webpack.config.js_](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive_frontend_development_2018/tree/cdb4bae60178ff8cb84deb048ae3ba7f93a069f5/lecture_1/webpack.config.js)\). Webpack resolves all module imports and outputs one file that can be included in the browser using a `<script>` tag. Various plugins can be included in the Webpack build process to perform additional changes to the source files.

#### Babel

JavaScript is a fast-changing language with many different runtimes \(browsers and their versions\). Babel allows using desired JavaScript features and syntax in the source code and _transpiling_ the source code to be parseable and executable by various browsers and their versions. Babel is configured \(in [_.babelrc_](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive_frontend_development_2018/tree/cdb4bae60178ff8cb84deb048ae3ba7f93a069f5/lecture_1/.babelrc/README.md)\) to transpile JavaScript source files to targeting a desired set of browsers\([specified using browserlist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist)\). `babel-loader` plugin is used \(configured in webpack.config.js\) to transpile files with Babel during the Webpack build process.

Compare the distribution JavaScript file generated by `yarn build` with the files in src/. Try running `yarn build` with different browser targets \(i.e remove "IE 10"\) and see how the distribution file changes.

#### Building on source file change

`yarn build:watch` refers to the `build:watch` script that is defined in [_package.json_](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive_frontend_development_2018/tree/cdb4bae60178ff8cb84deb048ae3ba7f93a069f5/lecture_1/package.json#L27). This is equivalent to running `./node_modules/.bin/webpack --config webpack.config.js --watch`. The `watch` flag instructs Webpack to automatically rebuild the bundle whenever any source file changes. New changes are visible after refreshing the web application in the browser.

#### Refreshing whenever source files change

`yarn start` refers to the `start` script that is defined in [_package.json_](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive_frontend_development_2018/tree/cdb4bae60178ff8cb84deb048ae3ba7f93a069f5/lecture_1/package.json#L28). This is equivalent to running `./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server --open --config webpack.config.js`. The `open` flag opens the default browser on the specified port \(default 8080\) on localhost.

Try changing [src/index.js](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive_frontend_development_2018/tree/cdb4bae60178ff8cb84deb048ae3ba7f93a069f5/lecture_1/src/index.js) and see that the browser pages refreshes automatically once you save your change.

#### Source Maps

[_webpack.config.js_](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive_frontend_development_2018/tree/cdb4bae60178ff8cb84deb048ae3ba7f93a069f5/lecture_1/webpack.config.js#L13) defines `devtool: "inline-source-map"` which instructs Webpack to add a link to the source code definitions to the end of app.js. This link is call a _source map_.

A _source map_ is a file which maps the transformed source \(app.js\) to the original source \(multiple files in src.js\). In the current case, a _source map_ isn't an URL to a file, but a base64 encoding of the whole source definition in base64. A web-browser will map the generated file \(app.js\) to the original source. This allows both the browser to execute JavaScript that it supports and the developer to debug their original, unchanged source code.
