## CSS

Cascading Style Sheets are used in web browsers to define how HTML is rendered visually: the color and font of text, alignment of different sections etc.

This course will not focus on how to build maintainable CSS.

However as with JavaScript files an important part of any source code is the ability to split it into manageable chunks. This can be achieved in CSS via CSS modules.

### CSS modules

CSS modules, similarly to modules in JavaScript, cannot be resolved by the web browser runtime. The modules must be resolved by the build tool.

There are various ways to include CSS modules in webpack build process. A very basic example is given in this example.

### Explanation

[_webpack.config.js_](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive_frontend_development_2018/tree/cdb4bae60178ff8cb84deb048ae3ba7f93a069f5/lecture_1/webpack.config.js) has two entries: one for the JavaScript index and one for the CSS index. A tool called `css-loader` is used to resolve CSS modules \(`@import` statements\). This tool is used via `extract-text-webpack-plugin` which helps to output a single CSS file in the webpack build chain.
