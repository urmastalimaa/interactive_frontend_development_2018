# Redux comment list example

## Running the application

```text
yarn install && yarn test && yarn start
```

Open _Redux basics example_ subpage.

## Explanation

## New dependencies

* [React-Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) has been added to

  [package.json](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive_frontend_development_2018/tree/cdb4bae60178ff8cb84deb048ae3ba7f93a069f5/lecture_4/package.json#L37)

## React with Redux

Redux is the core design pattern and react-redux adds the necessary bindings to use Redux with React.

All presentational components have remained nearly unchanged from previous examples.

React-Redux significantly changes how container components are defined.

## Redux Comment app

### Actions

This example application has [3 actions](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive_frontend_development_2018/tree/cdb4bae60178ff8cb84deb048ae3ba7f93a069f5/lecture_4/src/redux_basics/actions/index.js) that capture all user interactions.

* `COMMENT_SUBMITTED`
* `AUTHOR_SET`
* `TEXT_SET`

### Reducers

A [single reducer](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive_frontend_development_2018/tree/cdb4bae60178ff8cb84deb048ae3ba7f93a069f5/lecture_4/src/redux_basics/reducers/index.js) has been defined to handle all actions. New comments are added to comments already in the state. `AUTHOR_SET`, `TEXT_SET` actions are handled trivially.

### Application setup

[Application root](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive_frontend_development_2018/tree/cdb4bae60178ff8cb84deb048ae3ba7f93a069f5/lecture_4/src/redux_basics/ReduxBasics.js) has been changed to create a Redux store. This store is passed to child components using the `Provider` components which gives all children components access to the store.

### Container components

[`App`](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive_frontend_development_2018/tree/cdb4bae60178ff8cb84deb048ae3ba7f93a069f5/lecture_4/src/redux_basics/containers/App.js) container has been changed significantly. It defines a simple presentational component that contains all the other components. The presentational component receives all its props from a auto-generated wrapper component that is generated using _react-redux_.

Read the comments in [`App`](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive_frontend_development_2018/tree/cdb4bae60178ff8cb84deb048ae3ba7f93a069f5/lecture_4/src/redux_basics/containers/App.js) and react-redux documentation for more information.

### Tests

Component test have stayed unchanged, container tests have been changed to reducer tests. Tests for trivial containers can be omitted. If there is logic in `mapStateToProps` or `mapDispatchToProps`, extract that logic into _selector_ functions and test those in isolation.

Note that it is much nicer to test reducer functions than it is to test application logic through React components.

[`CommentForm`](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive_frontend_development_2018/tree/cdb4bae60178ff8cb84deb048ae3ba7f93a069f5/lecture_4/src/redux_basics/components/CommentForm.js) is changed to not have any internal state. This might or might not be desirable, depends on the use case. Check `CommentForm` for more information.

Redux dev tools [are integrated with store](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive_frontend_development_2018/tree/cdb4bae60178ff8cb84deb048ae3ba7f93a069f5/lecture_4/src/redux_basics/ReduxBasics.js#L15) if `devToolsExtension` is present on window.
