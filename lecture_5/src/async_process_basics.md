## Explanation

### Asynchronous processes

Every asynchronous processes has 3 stages: in-flight, succeeded, failed. All of these must be handled by the user interface.

Asynchronous processes are much more complex than synchronous processes. Redux helps, but careful though and design is required.

## Server simulation

A toy server has been added to the project. The server has simulated latency and intermittently fails to retrieve comments to simulate problems that can occur in real environments. The server accepts comments under POST /comments with JSON content type. Comments can be fetched using GET /comments.

## New dependencies

## Asynchronous actions in Redux

[Official documentation](https://redux.js.org/advanced/async-actions).

Thus far we have seen how to dispatch actions when something occurs in Redux. With asynchronous processes we have to dispatch two times, first when the process starts and again when the process finishes \(successfully or unsuccessfully\). The interim state of a request being in process or _in flight_ needs to be capture by our application.

### Components

Comments can now be fetched from a server. This request is asynchronous. [CommentList](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive_frontend_development_2018/tree/cdb4bae60178ff8cb84deb048ae3ba7f93a069f5/lecture_5/src/async_process_basics/components/CommentList.js#L20-36) has been changed to accomodate three different stages of the request: in-flight, success and error.

Submitting Comments is also asynchronous. Every comment itself can also be in-flight. [Comment](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive_frontend_development_2018/tree/cdb4bae60178ff8cb84deb048ae3ba7f93a069f5/lecture_5/src/async_process_basics/components/Comment.js) has been changed accordingly.

### Containers

Containers have been simply changed to pass the inFlight properties to the components.

### Reducers

[CommentListReducer](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive_frontend_development_2018/tree/cdb4bae60178ff8cb84deb048ae3ba7f93a069f5/lecture_5/src/async_process_basics/reducers/CommentListReducer.js) has been changed to handle 6 actions. 3 different possible results for both fetching and posting comments.

### Actions

There are 6 _simple_, synchronous action creators in the [actions file](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive_frontend_development_2018/tree/cdb4bae60178ff8cb84deb048ae3ba7f93a069f5/lecture_5/src/async_process_basics/actions/index.js) representing the different results of the two asynchronous processes. There are two asynchronous action creators for posting a comment and fetching all comments in [CommentServerActions](https://github.com/urmastalimaa/interactive_frontend_development_2018/tree/cdb4bae60178ff8cb84deb048ae3ba7f93a069f5/lecture_5/src/async_process_basics/actions/CommentServerActions.js). The asynchronous action creators make use of a [`fetch` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) which supports making requests to remote servers.

Note that the asynchronous action creators do not return a plain-object action, but a function. Returning a function is not supported natively by Redux, the capability is added by redux-thunk middleware.

### Redux thunk

Redux thunk middleware supports returning functions \(_thunks_\) from action creators. These functions are executed by the middleware with the `dispatch` function from store given as a parameter. This means that the _thunk_ function can call dispatch multiple times or at a later time.

_Thunk_ functions usually call other, synchronous action creators to dispatch actions.

Example:

```javascript
let timer;
export const fetchComments = () => {
  return dispatch => {
    timer = setTimeout(
      () => dispatch(receivedComments(['comment1', 'comment2'])),
      1000
    )
  }
}
```

## Testing

Components and reducers can be tested as usual. Testing `fetch` API usage is achieved by using an optional parameter which defaults to `window.fetch` for the asynchronous actions creators. Tests simply pass a stub function as the optional argument.

### Redux mock store

Redux mock store is a very simple mock interface for a Redux store that records all received actions. This is used for testing the asynchronous action creators.
