# Lecture 7

Lecture 7 introduces DOM History API to give URLs back their meaning in single
page applications.

## Study goals

## DOM History API

* What is DOM history API?
* What problem does it solve?

## Declarative routing in single page applications using React Router

* What is React Router and what problem does it solve?

[Router basics](./src/router-basics/README.md)

## Capturing history state in Redux

* How to sync history API state with Redux?

[Connected React Router](./src/connected-react-router/README.md)

## Optimizing React applications

React performs many internal optimizations, starting from the virtual DOM
implementation to optimizing pure function components.

React-Redux containers implement `shouldComponentUpdate` trivially to avoid
unnecessary re-renders.

* How to take full advatage of React-Redux container optimizations?
